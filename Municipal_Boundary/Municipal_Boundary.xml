            <supplinf>Miami-Dade County, previously known as Dade County, Home Rule Charter was adopted May 21, 1957.
  
Municipalities created after the Home Rule Charter, legal description can be found on www.municode.com.  Click on Municode Library tab, select State, click on Miami-Dade County then click on Miami - Dade County Code of Ordinances.  To the left of the page scroll down to Appendix A (contains the creation of Municipalities after the Home Rule) and Appendix B (contains Annexation and De-annexation after the Home Rule).
 
Municipalities created prior to the Home Rule, were processed through the Florida State Legislation, until the formation of Miami Dade County.  To obtain a copy of their legal description one would need go to the City's Clerk or use the above mentioned website, but click on the City of interest instead of Miami Dade County and you may find their Charter.

Home Rule is a constitutional delegation to Miami-Dade County of specific decision making powers and authority which were formerly reserved to the state, subject to a county charter as approved by the voters of Miami-Dade County.  See: Sections 6(e) and 11 of Article VIII of the Constitution of the State of Florida, http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&amp;Submenu=3&amp;Tab=statutes  

A copy of Miami Dade County Home Rule Charter can be found at http://www.miamidade.gov/charterreview/ or http://www.miamidade.gov/charter/library/Charter-01-26-07.pdf

Also, the boundaries are the same as those found in the REDI Plat Volumes with other references from the Official Map of Miami-Dade County Florida, 1989, and the shoreline coverage.  The Rand McNally Miami Metro map was used originally.

A second area of annexation is the tiny triangular portion, formerly a part of Dade, lying between the railroad and NW 82nd avenue.

Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
Data is reviewed by GIS Data Administrator and GIS Metadata Administrator.

Other_References_Cited:
Created by: Charlton Lewis of Miami-Dade County, on November 26th, 1990.

The boundaries are the same as those found in the REDI Plat Volumes with other references from the Official Map of Dade County Florida, 1989, and the shoreline coverage.  The Rand McNally Miami Metro map was also used.

Notes:
Incorporation is done throught an election process.  The results can be found on the Miami-Dade County Elections Department website, after the votes have been casted and determined. The municipality is adopted and becomes effective immediately, providing it received the majority of votes.

Annexations, with less than two hundred and fifty residence in the proposed area goes before the Board of County Commissioners, where it is accepted or withdrawn.  On the other hand, if the total affected residence is more than two hundred and fifty then, it goes through the election process mentioned above.

Conditions for each Incorporation, Annexation or De-annexation could vary.
